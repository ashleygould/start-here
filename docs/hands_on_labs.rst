Hands-on Labs - From Console to Code
====================================

The following is a series of self-paced lab exercises designed to introduce new
users to management of AWS resources with code.  Work on each exercise using
all of the following AWS deployment methods:

- AWS console
- AWS CLI
- CloudFormation
- boto3 SDK
- boto3 SDK with unit-test

Submit your solutions to your personal GitHub account in a repository named
``hands-on-lab-solutions``.  Your console solutions should consist of a
step-by-step instruction set or a series of screen-shots or both.  AWS CLI
solutions can be shell script or a cut-n-paste of your shell session.
