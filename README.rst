Entry point for on-boarding new UCOPACME team members
-----------------------------------------------------

Here we do AWS Infrastructure as Code.  To get up to speed you will
need to set up a few prerequisites.  See the ``docs`` section for
specifics:

- Git Setup
- Python Virtual Environment Setup
- AWS CLI Environment Setup
- Cloud9 Environment Setup
- Complete the Hands-On Labs


We will be building administrative tools to support AWS Governance using
a combination of AWS CloudFormation and the Boto3 AWS SDK.  So in
essence, we are a software development team.  As such, we want to foster
these software development best practices:

- Clean Code
- Test Driven Development
- Definition of Done
- Automated Testing
- Automated Documentation
- Continuous Integration/Deployment
